1.)     On a Word document (or otherwise) or on a piece of paper, please answer the following questions:
a)       What does this program do? (a few sentences)
b)      What does the ‘*’ symbol mean in the above code? (a sentence or two)
c)       If the user inputs ‘3’, then ‘2’ and finally ‘10’, what would the output look like? (the actual output, character for character)
2.)     EXTENSION (optional)
a)       What would happen if I entered a negative number?
b)      If I entered a non-numeric character, what would happen?
3.)     SUPER EXTENSION (super optional)
a)       Use the attached document to enhance the program.
     i.      Alert the user if they have made an invalid/incorrect input
     ii.      Create a loop to allow the user to keep inputting different combinations until they input an ‘X’
     iii.      SUPER DUPER EXTENSION – Adjust the program to output a Fibonacci Sequence from a desired starting number (yes, this will substantially change the program)
b)      Please adjust the author to include both your name (and my name if appropriate)
c)       Increase the version number when you are happy with it
 
Please note that extension work is obviously still optional but recommended. Good solutions will certainly be in line to earn T-Ticks, Optima etc.
